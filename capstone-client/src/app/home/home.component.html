    <h1>What is Supplier Finance?</h1>
    <img src="../../assets/Images/Questions-pana.png"  alt="photo">
    <p>
      Supplier finance (or ‘supply chain finance’) is a type of cash advance.
      It’s a way for smaller businesses to benefit from the higher credit scores
      of their buyers, and for buyers to lengthen their payment terms. That
      might sound confusing, here’s how it works.

    <h1>How does it work?</h1>

    <p>
      Large multinational companies are highly likely to honour invoices from
      suppliers. That means the suppliers that work with them can get 100% of
      the value advanced from a lender, minus a small fee, once the buyer has
      approved the invoice for payment because at this stage, the risk of
      non-payment is very low.
